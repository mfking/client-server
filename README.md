## To Run Server

To run the server, change directory to `/server`, then you must first build it:

```
npm run build
```

This will create the `dist/index.js` file.

The server can then be run with the command:

```
npm run start
```

To confirm the server is running, you should see `Server listening on 3001` in the console.

## To Run Client

To run the client, in a separate termina, change directoy to `/client` and run

```
npm run start
```

Then, in a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
